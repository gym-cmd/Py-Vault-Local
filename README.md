> A secure, local-first, command-line password manager built with Python. Your digital life, sealed in your own private vault.

</div>

---

**Py-Vault** is a robust password manager that runs directly in your terminal. It provides a secure, offline-first solution to store, manage, and generate your sensitive credentials without relying on third-party cloud services. You control your data completely.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üîí **Strong Encryption:** Utilizes Fernet (AES-256-GCM) for authenticated symmetric encryption. Your data is encrypted and authenticated at every step.
-   üîë **Secure Key Derivation:** Your master password is never stored. It's combined with a unique salt and processed through PBKDF2HMAC with 600,000 iterations to derive the encryption key, providing excellent protection against brute-force attacks.
-   üîé **Data Integrity:** All vault files, including backups, are sealed with an HMAC signature to prevent tampering. The application will refuse to load any file that has been modified.
-   üé≤ **Secure Password Generator:** Includes a built-in password generator to create cryptographically strong random passwords.
-   ‚è±Ô∏è **Auto-Clipboard Clearing:** Automatically clears passwords from your system clipboard after a 2-minute delay to prevent accidental exposure.
-   üì¶ **Portable & Secure Backup:** Features a clear, secure process for creating a recovery kit to restore your vault on a new machine.
-   üßØ **Automatic Safety Net:** Keeps a rolling history of the last 10 versions of your vault as an automatic safety net, protecting you against accidental data loss.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

Your vault's security is built on a layered model where you hold the keys.

1.  **The Master Password (Your Secret):** This is the password you memorize and the primary key to your vault. It is never stored on disk.
2.  **The Salt File (`salt.bin`):** This is a random, unique "serial number" for your vault. It is not a secret, but it is essential for deriving the correct encryption key from your master password.
3.  **The Encryption Key:** The final key used to encrypt/decrypt data is created by combining your **Master Password** and the **`salt.bin`** file.

To unlock your data, the application needs **both** your master password and the matching `salt.bin` file. This is why the `salt.bin` is a critical part of your recovery kit when moving to a new computer.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone or Download**
    Get the project files (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`) and place them in a dedicated folder. Navigate into that folder in your terminal.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    -   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   **On macOS & Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *(Your terminal prompt should now change to show `(venv)`)*

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    With the virtual environment active, install all the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

### First-Time Setup

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is active.
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  The application will guide you through creating a strong master password. **Choose a password you will not forget, as it is unrecoverable.**
4.  After setup, the application will have created your local vault files: `master.key`, `salt.bin`, and `vault.json`.

### Main Menu

| Option                      | Description                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[1] Add Password`          | Save a new credential. You can provide a password or have one generated.  |
| `[2] View Passwords`        | List all saved services and view the details for a specific entry.        |
| `[3] Generate Password`     | Create a strong, random password without saving it to the vault.          |
| `[4] Delete Password`       | Permanently remove a credential from the vault.                           |
| `[5] Create Recovery Backup`| Create a secure, portable backup file for moving your vault.              |
| `[6] Restore from Backup`   | Import a vault from a recovery backup file.                               |
| `[0] Lock Vault & Exit`     | Securely exit the application.                                            |

## üîÑ Backup and Restore on a New Machine

This is the most critical process to understand. To securely move your vault, you must transfer **both** the encrypted data and the unique salt file.

### Step 1: On Your OLD Computer (Create the Recovery Kit)

1.  Run the application (`python main.py`) and log in.
2.  Choose option **[5] Create Recovery Backup**.
3.  The application will create `vault_recovery.json` and display a critical message with instructions.
4.  Locate the **TWO required files** for your recovery kit:
    -   `vault_recovery.json`
    -   `salt.bin`
5.  Securely copy **both files** to a portable medium (e.g., an encrypted USB drive).

    ```
    OLD_COMPUTER/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ master.key
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ salt.bin              <-- COPY THIS FILE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vault.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vault_recovery.json   <-- AND COPY THIS FILE
    ```

### Step 2: On Your NEW Computer (Restore the Vault)

1.  Create a new, empty folder.
2.  Place the necessary files into this new folder:
    -   Your `main.py` script.
    -   The `requirements.txt` file.
    -   The `vault_recovery.json` file from your recovery kit.
    -   The `salt.bin` file from your recovery kit.
3.  Follow the **Installation** steps above (create/activate venv, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4.  Run the application (`python main.py`).
5.  It will initiate the "First-time setup." This is normal. Enter your **original Master Password**.
6.  Once at the main menu, choose option **[6] Restore from Backup** and provide the `vault_recovery.json` filename.

Your vault is now fully restored and ready to use on the new machine.

## üì¶ Creating an Executable

You can package this application into a single executable file using `PyInstaller`.

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```
2.  **Build the Executable:**
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --name PyVault main.py
    ```
3.  Your `PyVault.exe` (or `PyVault` on Mac/Linux) will be in the `dist` folder. Remember that it still needs the `vault.json`, `master.key`, and `salt.bin` files in the same directory to function.
